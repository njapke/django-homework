# django-homework
This website was created for an assignment in the module Soziale Netzwerke at TU Berlin.
It implements a Todo-Tracker using Python 3 and Django 1.11 with an SQLite database.

## Usage
To test this website, the webserver included in Django can be used. Just clone this directory
and run "python manage.py runserver" in the root directory. Depending on your OS and Python environment,
you may need to call "python3" instead of just "python" to get Python 3 to run.

## Todos (since we don't use a tracker yet, like this very website)
* Code cleanup
* Find a better Todo tracker than a README.md
* Writing a nice readme into this file
